- ✅ Progress tracking templates
- ✅ Communication protocols
- ✅ Status dashboards
- ✅ Quality assurance

**Use this for:** Software development, research projects, content creation, data analysis, system migrations, or any complex multi-part work.

---

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### The Multi-AI Approach

Instead of one AI doing everything sequentially, split work across multiple AI sessions:

```
Project

├── Chat A: Backend development
├── Chat B: Frontend development
├── Chat C: Database work
├── Chat D: Testing & QA
└── Chat E: Documentation
```

**Benefits:**

- ⚡ 5x faster completion (parallel execution)
- 🎯 Each AI focuses on one domain
- 📊 Clear accountability per task
- 🔄 Easy to track progress
- 🚨 Early detection of issues

### Task Division Playbook (Lessons Learned)

Use specialty-based "swim lanes" to minimize overlap and surface blockers early:

| Lane | Typical Owner | Charter | When to Spin Up |
|------|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Build** | Chats A/B | Feature or infrastructure delivery | Always |
| **Operations & Monitoring** | Chat E | Watch health metrics, run diagnostics, validate deployments | When long-running jobs or infra changes are involved |
| **Incident Response / Investigation** | Chat D | Trace root causes, design mitigations, test fixes | For critical bugs or outages |
| **Data / Analytics** | Chat C | Migrations, transformations, large queries | When data shape changes or accuracy matters |
| **Commander Feedback Loop** | Commander | Approve work, redirect tasks, celebrate wins | Throughout |

**Tips:**

- Pair a builder chat with a mirror ops chat (e.g., Chat B builds analytics UI while Chat E measures API latency).
- Keep investigation tasks time-boxed; if scope balloons, reassign as a separate round with dedicated estimate.
- Document pivots (e.g., Option A → Option B+) immediately in the logs so all lanes adjust together.

```

### Interaction Archive & Timeline Tracking

Create a dedicated log archive to capture every commander/chat interaction with timestamps. This becomes invaluable during retrospectives, incident investigations, or when spinning up new collaborators.

```
coordination/

├── logs/
│   ├── 2025-11-09/
│   │   ├── 15-25_commander_update_booking.md
│   │   ├── 15-31_chat_E_monitoring_plan.md
│   │   ├── 15-35_commander_approval_option_B_plus.md
│   │   └── ...
│   └── [date]/
└── ...
```

**Tips:**

- Use `HH-MM_subject.md` naming for quick chronological scanning.
- Start each log file with a 2–3 line summary plus links to related order/answer files.
- Capture pivots, approvals, blocker resolutions, and celebration notes here so future rounds can reference them without scanning entire chats.

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Setup

### Phase 1: Planning (30 minutes)

**1. Break Down Your Project**

List all major tasks:

```markdown
# Project: [Your Project Name]

## Major Tasks

1. Task A: [Description] - Est: [XX] hours
2. Task B: [Description] - Est: [XX] hours
3. Task C: [Description] - Est: [XX] hours
4. Task D: [Description] - Est: [XX] hours
5. Task E: [Description] - Est: [XX] hours
```

**2. Identify Dependencies**

```markdown
## Task Dependencies

- Task A: No dependencies (can start immediately)
- Task B: Depends on Task A (50% complete)
- Task C: No dependencies (can start immediately)
- Task D: Depends on A and B complete
- Task E: Depends on all tasks (final step)
```

**3. Assign to Chats**

```markdown
## Chat Assignments

**Chat A - [Task Name]:**

- **Chat [Y]** completed [prerequisite]
- **Chat [Z]** needs your output for [downstream task]

---

**Start when ready! Good luck! 🚀**
```

---

### Phase 3: Launch Chats

**For Each Chat:**

1. Open new AI chat window
2. Send this message:

```
Hi! You are Chat [LETTER] in a multi-AI coordination system.

Please read the attached order_chat_[LETTER]_[N].md file and execute
the tasks described. Follow the time management protocol (10% timeout
rule). Create answer_chat_[LETTER]_[N].md when complete.

Your task: [Brief description]

Estimated time: [XX] minutes

Priority: [Priority level]

Let's go! 🚀
```

3. Attach the order file

---

### Phase 4: Monitor Progress

**Create `COMMAND_CENTER.md` to track everything:**

```markdown
# 🎯 Command Center - [Project Name]

**Last Updated:** [Time]

## Current Status

| Chat | Task | Status | Progress | ETA | Next |
|------|------|--------|----------|-----|------|
| A | [Task] | 🔄 In Progress | 60% | [Time] | Continue |
| B | [Task] | ✅ Complete | 100% | Done | Round 2 |
| C | [Task] | ⏳ Pending | 0% | Not started | After A |
| D | [Task] | ⚠️ Blocked | 30% | TBD | Needs help |
| E | [Task] | 🔄 In Progress | 45% | [Time] | Continue |

## Recent Updates

**[Time] - Chat A:** Completed Task 1, starting Task 2

**[Time] - Chat D:** Hit blocker, created question file

**[Time] - Chat E:** Posted 45% progress update

## Active Issues

- ⚠️ Chat D blocked on [issue] - needs input from Chat A
- 🚨 Chat C hasn't started (waiting for Chat A)

## Completed This Round

- ✅ Chat B - [Task completed]

## Next Actions

1. Review question_D_to_commander_1.md
2. Check answer_B_1.md results
3. Start Chat C when Chat A hits 80%
```

### Standby Monitoring Loop

Quando um chat finalizar suas tarefas e não tiver novas ordens imediatas:

1. Registrar conclusão e próximos passos no log diário (`coordination/logs/chat_[LETRA]/YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
2. Entrar em modo sentinela (`.sleep 300`).
3. Ao despertar, revisar `COMMAND_CENTER.md`, chat geral, perguntas/alertas e logs relevantes (pipeline, dashboards, etc.).
4. Se houver nova demanda, encerrar o modo sentinela e iniciar planejamento/execução; caso contrário, repetir o ciclo (anotando no log quando pertinente).

---

## ⏰ Time Management Protocol

### The 10% Rule

**Core Principle:** If any task takes >10% longer than estimated, STOP and reassess.

**Example:**

- Task estimated: 30 minutes
- Timeout threshold: 33 minutes (30 + 10%)
- If not done by 33 minutes → STOP

### Why This Works

- ⏱️ Prevents wasting time on stuck tasks
- 🎯 Forces early problem detection
- 💡 Promotes asking for help sooner
- 📊 Improves estimation accuracy over time

### Implementation

**1. At Task Start:**

Every chat adds this to their work:

```markdown
# [Task Name] - Time Tracking

**Started:** 14:00

**Estimated Duration:** 30 minutes

**Expected Completion:** 14:30

**Timeout Threshold:** 14:33 (ETA + 10%)

## Task Breakdown

| Subtask | Est | Actual | Status |
|---------|-----|--------|--------|
| Setup | 5m | - | ⏳ |
| Implementation | 20m | - | ⏳ |
| Testing | 5m | - | ⏳ |
```

**2. Every 15 Minutes:**

Post a progress update:

```markdown
## Progress Update - 14:15

**Elapsed:** 15 min / 30 min (50%)

**Status:** ✅ On Track

Current: Implementation phase

Completed: Setup

Remaining: Implementation (5m), Testing (5m)

ETA Still Valid: Yes
```

**3. At Timeout Threshold:**

If task isn't 90%+ done, STOP and create alert:

```markdown
# ⚠️ TIMEOUT ALERT - [Task Name]

**Overrun:** 3 minutes (10%)

**Root Cause:** [Why it took longer]

## Current Progress

- ✅ Setup complete
- 🔄 Implementation 70% done
- ⏳ Testing not started

**Decision:** Continue

**Reason:** Implementation nearly done (10 more minutes)

**New ETA:** 14:43
```

**4. In Answer File:**

Include time summary:

```markdown
# Time Tracking Summary

**Total Duration:** 35 minutes

**Original Estimate:** 30 minutes

**Accuracy:** 86% (30/35 * 100)

**On Time:** ⚠️ Overrun by 5 minutes

**Time Breakdown:**

| Subtask | Est | Actual | Variance |
|---------|-----|--------|----------|
| Setup | 5m | 4m | -1m ✅ |
| Implementation | 20m | 26m | +6m ⚠️ |
| Testing | 5m | 5m | 0m ✅ |

**Why Overrun:**

Implementation was more complex than expected due to [reason].

**Lessons Learned:**

Add 5-10 minute buffer for [type of task] in future estimates.

## 📈 Best Practices

### For Commanders

**DO:**

- ✅ Stand up dedicated lanes (Build / Ops / Investigation / Data) and keep scope tight per lane.
- ✅ Mirror each mission with a feedback plan: approval files, celebration notes, and next-order scaffolding.
- ✅ Log every major decision with timestamp + file link (keeps multi-day efforts coherent).
- ✅ Break work into independent, parallel tasks when possible
- ✅ Set clear success criteria for each task
- ✅ Review answer files within 30 minutes
- ✅ Update COMMAND_CENTER.md frequently
- ✅ Respond to questions/alerts quickly
- ✅ Give credit for good work
- ✅ Learn from timing data

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Create tasks with too many dependencies
- ❌ Assign vague or unclear objectives
- ❌ Ignore timeout alerts
- ❌ Let blocked chats wait too long
- ❌ Skip time tracking reviews
- ❌ Let praise or approvals remain implicit—send explicit acknowledgments.
- ❌ Forget to close the loop in logs when pivots/decisions happen.

### For Chat Agents

**DO:**

- ✅ Read the entire order file before starting
- ✅ Start with time tracking block
- ✅ Update progress every 15 minutes
- ✅ Stop at timeout threshold
- ✅ Ask questions early if unclear
- ✅ Document everything in answer file
- ✅ Be honest about challenges
- ✅ Reference log timestamps when raising blockers or answering questions.

**DON'T:**

- ❌ Skip time tracking
- ❌ Work past timeout without alerting
- ❌ Make assumptions - ask questions
- ❌ Hide issues or delays
- ❌ Forget to create answer file
